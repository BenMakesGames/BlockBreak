## Block-break

Block-break is a Breakout clone written in [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/), using the [PlayPlayMini framework](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/PlayPlayMini). It demonstrates using the following:

* Multiple PlayPlayMini game states: a loading screen, title menu, settings menu, gameplay, pause menu, high-score entry, and a high-score table
* Sprite sheets, fonts, pictures, and sound effects
* SQLite & [EntityFramework 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework), for storing the high score table and settings
* [Serilog](https://serilog.net/), for logging errors to a text file
